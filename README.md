<div>Zig Zag - The Zig Zag function makes use of a while True infinite loop and the time.sleep() function to slow down the rendering of our program in the terminal. Every tenth of a second the program prints again on a different line but with a ' ' before or after the text to give the illusion the text is "zigzagging" down the page like a snake.</div>

<div>Call Stack Function - The Call Stack Function is how Python remembers where a function first started and then returns there after the function is complete. It is usually running behind the scenes but it is demonstrated here. </div>

<div>Collatz Sequence - The Collatz function takes one integer. If the integer is even then it is divided by 2, if it is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. No one is sure why, but whatever integer is given the final result is always one.</div>
